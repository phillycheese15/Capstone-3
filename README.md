# Capstone-3 Final
This Capstone is a python project 

On this project I did my work in google colab, I got my data from kaggle and it was the NBA Stats from 2014-2018 
I did alot of different visuals as you will see I focused alot of the visuals on how the scoring went up each year and was breaking records in shooting percentages and 3 points attempts and 3 point makes
